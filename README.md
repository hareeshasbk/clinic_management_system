# Clinic Management System

## Overview

This project is a **Clinic Management System** developed as a final-year Computer Science diploma engineering project. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing appointments, tracking medications, and implementing role-based user access in a clinic environment. The system is built using Django (a Python web framework), SQLite (for development), and Bootstrap (for the front-end).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hareeshasbk/clinic-management-system.git
   cd clinic-management-project  # Adjust to match your folder name
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Django:**
   ```bash
   pip install Django
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**
   After installing Django, use the following command to install all other required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Apply Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Create a Superuser (Optional):**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

9. **Access the Application:**
   Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation:** Prevents XSS and other injection attacks.
- **Password Hashing:** Uses Django’s built-in authentication system for secure password storage.
- **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS in deployment to encrypt communication (see the "HTTPS and SSL/TLS Implementation" section).
- **RBAC:** Limits access to sensitive features and data based on user roles.
